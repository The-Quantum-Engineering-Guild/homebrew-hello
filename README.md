# homebrew-hello
Homebrew tap for a simple "hello world" test bottle built for the Alpine proot-distro distro on termux using the armv7 achitecture. 
It's also important to notice that Alpine linux is based on [musl lib c](https://musl.libc.org). Therefore, a glibc based system won't be able to run the program in this tap. Now trying to build it with GitHub Actions, but since this thing is and ARM binary for a musl based proot-distro system, is it better to do it locally? Retrying... Still retrying....
