## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install the-quantum-engineering-guild/hello/<formula>`

Or `brew tap the-quantum-engineering-guild/hello` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or, in a [`brew bundle`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "the-quantum-engineering-guild/hello"
brew "<formula>"
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
=======
# homebrew-hello
Homebrew tap for a simple "hello world" test bottle built for the Alpine proot-distro distro on termux using the armv7 achitecture. 
It's also important to notice that Alpine linux is based on [musl lib c](https://musl.libc.org). Therefore, a glibc based system won't be able to run the program in this tap. Now trying to build it with GitHub Actions, but since this thing is and ARM binary for a musl based proot-distro system, is it better to do it locally? Retrying... Still retrying....
